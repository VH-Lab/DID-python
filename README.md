# Data Interface Database

The did-python library is a versioned database API built to manage [DID documents](https://github.com/VH-Lab/DID-matlab/wiki/Discussion-on-DID-document-core) and associated binary data.

It is a port from DID-matlab (https://github.com/VH-lab/DID-matlab)

The Python package makes use of [native namespace packages available in Python 3.3 and later](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages).
